# The Jewish Bookshelf Project (JBS)
In the JBS project we build a RDF [Linked Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) for the *Jewish bookshelf* (JBS). The project consists of the following major efforts:
- Defining a JBS [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language).
- Representating the *structure* of various Jewish texts in RDF format, based on the defined ontology.
- Conducting a varierty of *text analysis* tasks on the texts, and representing the results also in RDF.
